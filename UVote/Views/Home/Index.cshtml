    <h1>Welcome to UVote!</h1>
    <p>
        If you want to vote in the student elections you have arrived at the right place!
        No more standing in line and showing ID; all it takes is two minutes of your precious time
        and then you can return to procrastinating over your assignments, eating unhealthy food and generally
        doing anything other than studying. That's what you're here for.

                        Students last year voted to reduce paper waste in the college and so the idea for UVote
                        online was born. Thanks for trying it. If you have any ideas for improving our
                        online voting system, please don't hesitate to let us know. Our ears are always open! info@uvote.com
